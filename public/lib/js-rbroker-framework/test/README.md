DeployR JavaScript RBroker Framework Unit Tests
===============================================

The DeployR JavaScript RBroker Framework ships with a set of unit tests.

```
$ npm test
```

By default, the build configuration assumes an instance of the DeployR server
is running on `localhost`. If your instance of DeployR is running at some
other IP address then please udpate the `endpoint` property in the
config.json configuration file as appropriate.
